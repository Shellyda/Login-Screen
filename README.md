The initial idea of ​​the project was very simple: Create a <b>*Login / Register Screen*</b> with one <b>*Interactive menu*</b> made with jQuery, a library of JavaScript functions :yellow_heart: 
</br>
It came up in one of my conversations about Web Development with a <b>Incredible Desginer</b> and my friend, <b>Albertino Junior</b> (<a href="https://instagram.com/gcdraw.er?igshid=1e2ncl0gfttlv">@gcdraw.er</a>)!! 
</br>
In this way, I introduced the Frontend world to this young grasshopper who had never produced anything in the web standard before:star: :star::star:

##### OBS: The Muckup made by Albertino for this project is also available above at the file named "LOGIN SCREEN.pdf"!!
